# Description

Write a short description for your feature/bugfix here (by replacing this block.)

This will help people understand your PR and could be used later in a documentation:
- In case of a bugfix, please describe in a simple way how your code will fix the addressed issue, and if possible add a short example to demonstrate your fixed issue
- In case of a feature, please describe how and in which part of the project the feature can be used, and if possible add a short implementation example of your feature
